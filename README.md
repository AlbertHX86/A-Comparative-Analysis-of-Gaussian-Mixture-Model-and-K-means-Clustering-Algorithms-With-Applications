# UROP
Bayesian clustering, GMM and K-Means with real-world applications
This is my UROP project with the supervision of Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering @ NUS.
This report mainly focuses on Bayesian Clustering and its applications to smart grids and EV charging pricing systems.
It is discovered that by apply clustering algorithms to EV charging data, the users' charging behaviors can be discovered, which would be advantageous to TOU pricing system and reduce the load of the grids during peak hours.
